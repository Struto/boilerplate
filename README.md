boilerplate
===========

We're currently developing new boilerplates for new sites. This is meant work
as a lighter, customized variant of something like Twitter Bootstrap or the
HTML5 Boilerplate, by focusing on our uses, aligning things with our semantics,
and being willing to allow for slightly more variance between browsers.

We're targeting IE8+, Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. We're aiming for the site to
still be functional in IE7, however we'll willing to accept visual degradation.
